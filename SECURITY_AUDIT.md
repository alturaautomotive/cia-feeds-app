## 🟢 May 15, 2026 update — Roadmap status

All **today / this week / this month** roadmap items (#1–25) have shipped. Posture is now **A−** (was B−). Outstanding items are limited to:

- **Quarterly nice-to-haves** (#26–30): SOC-2 Type-I readiness, third-party pen test, bug bounty, Lead PII app-layer encryption, PITR retention verification.
- **CSP enforce flip**: Report-Only since May 12, zero violations logged. Cutover target Tuesday May 19 (7-day soak).
- **Dependabot deferred majors**: vitest 2→4 (PR #5), `@google/genai` 0.x→2.x (PR #7), vite+vitest (PR #8). zod 3→4 (PR #6) and Next.js 16.2.6 (PR #1) merged May 15.

This week's adds beyond the original roadmap:
- Migration drift reconciliation + `prisma migrate deploy` in Vercel build (no more silent schema gaps).
- Tracking-secret backfill for all 22 dealers + `TRACK_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE=true` (HMAC enforced on `/api/track`).
- Custom-domain auto-attach env vars wired (`VERCEL_API_TOKEN`/`PROJECT_ID`/`TEAM_ID`).
- Circuit breakers extended to Gemini + Resend; Firecrawl + OpenAI were already wrapped.
- DB-outage graceful degradation (`lib/dbResilience.ts`): retry on transient Postgres errors + clean 503 with `Retry-After: 30` on public read paths.
- `docs/EMPLOYEE_ACCESS_POLICY.md` and `docs/DR_RUNBOOK.md` published in-repo.

---

## Executive summary

**Overall posture: B− (Strong-good foundation with 4 high-priority gaps before enterprise marketing claims hold up).**

The team has done a lot right: AES-256-GCM at-rest encryption of Meta tokens, JWT sessions with NextAuth, durable rate limiting with a fail-closed variant, an immutable audit log with field redaction, Stripe webhook signature verification with idempotency, a sophisticated Meta delivery queue with leases / coalescing / circuit breaker, DB-backed OAuth `state` (not cookies), Postgres connection pooling, RLS now enabled on every public table, secrets centralized in Vercel env, and TLS + HSTS at the edge.

The 4 gaps that block honest enterprise positioning:

1. **🔴 Critical — Dual auth surface (orphaned Supabase Auth schema alongside Prisma/NextAuth)** running unused but still callable.
2. **🔴 Critical — Authenticated-IDOR risk via `getEffectiveDealerId()`** — the cookie-set helper trusts `session.user.id` as the dealer ID for *all* logged-in users (including TeamUsers and Supabase-Auth `profiles` rows), with no defense-in-depth check that the session was actually a Dealer.
3. **🟠 High — No security headers at the edge** (no CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy). Easy XSS pivot and clickjacking exposure.
4. **🟠 High — In-memory rate limiter still backing public surfaces** (`/api/catalog/[slug]`, `/api/leads`, `/api/track`) — resets every cold start in Vercel serverless, providing essentially no protection against a low-and-slow attacker.

Plus a clutch of medium issues (password policy, bcrypt cost factor, missing CSRF on cookie-set admin GET, missing webhook for Meta deletions, public storage bucket listing, `handle_new_user` SECURITY DEFINER reachable by anon role, vulnerable Next.js 16.2.1 below the patch line for two HIGH-severity DoS CVEs).

With ~3 days of focused work you can credibly market this as "enterprise-ready security posture." Without those 3 days, claims like "SOC-2 aligned" or "enterprise-grade" would be aspirational at best.

## Domain 1 — Identity & Access Management

### F-1.1 🔴 Critical: Dual authentication systems

**Evidence:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — `Dealer`, `TeamUser`, `PasswordResetToken` models drive NextAuth credentials login.
- Supabase DB inspection shows a second, fully populated schema running in parallel:
  - `public.profiles` (id, email, full_name, stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id, subscription_status) — **0 rows currently, but the table exists with RLS policies referencing `auth.uid()`**
  - `public.dealerships` (id, user_id → auth.users, name, website, feed_url) — 0 rows
  - `public.handle_new_user()` SECURITY DEFINER trigger function — flagged by Supabase advisor (`function_search_path_mutable`, `anon_security_definer_function_executable`, `authenticated_security_definer_function_executable`)
  - 4 RLS policies on `profiles`, 4 on `dealerships`, all keyed on `(select auth.uid())`
- `lib/supabase.ts` uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (not the user JWT), so the app never actually consumes the Supabase Auth path. This is dead code/schema.
- **Risk:** any anon/publishable key holder can call `/rest/v1/rpc/handle_new_user` directly. If that function performs an `INSERT` (typical pattern for this trigger), it can be used to **create rows in `auth.users` + `profiles` + `dealerships` without going through your app's signup**, completely bypassing the rate limit, email verification, Stripe trial logic, and admin signup notification. Whether or not anyone is logged in.

**Business impact:** Account-spoofing path, abuse of Supabase Auth quota, and a maintenance landmine that confuses future engineers. Auditors will deduct for "unused privileged code paths reachable from untrusted networks."

**Remediation (recommended, in order):**
1. Inspect `handle_new_user`: `SELECT pg_get_functiondef(oid) FROM pg_proc WHERE proname='handle_new_user';`
2. If unused, drop it: `DROP FUNCTION public.handle_new_user;` and remove the trigger that calls it.
3. Drop the unused tables: `DROP TABLE public.profiles; DROP TABLE public.dealerships;` (both have 0 rows).
4. Disable Supabase Auth entirely if not used elsewhere: Project Settings → Authentication → Providers → disable email/password and external providers; or revoke `anon` and `authenticated` privileges on the `public` schema (`REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM anon, authenticated;`).
5. Document the single source of truth in `README.md`: "Auth: NextAuth (JWT) + Prisma `Dealer`/`TeamUser`. Supabase is used only as a Postgres host + storage; Supabase Auth is disabled."

**Effort:** 1–2 hours.

**Controls:** NIST SP 800-53 AC-2 (Account Management), AC-6 (Least Privilege); SOC-2 CC6.1.

---

### F-1.2 🔴 Critical: Authenticated-IDOR via `getEffectiveDealerId()`

**Evidence:**
- `lib/impersonation.ts:55-66` — `getEffectiveDealerContext()` returns `session.user.id` as `effectiveDealerId` for **any** logged-in user, with no check that the session actually corresponds to a `Dealer` row.
- `lib/auth.ts:62-95` — TeamUser login flow sets `id: teamUser.dealer.id` (the dealer's ID, not the team user's). This is intentional for shared inventory access but means **every TeamUser session carries the underlying Dealer's ID as `session.user.id`**.
- All dashboard routes (`app/api/vehicles/[id]`, `app/api/listings/[id]`, `app/api/profile`, `app/api/fb/*`, `app/api/meta/*`) trust `getEffectiveDealerId()` as the authoritative dealer scope.
- **Risk model:** This is OK *if* the only paths to the JWT are signup (creates a Dealer) and team accept (creates a TeamUser linked to a Dealer). It breaks the moment:
  - A future code path puts a non-Dealer id into `session.user.id` (Supabase Auth users via the parallel schema in F-1.1 — `auth.uid()` is a UUID just like Dealer IDs and `findFirst({ id })` will silently return nothing or, worse, match unrelated)
  - An attacker steals a Stripe webhook ID, a Lead ID, or any UUID and replays it as a session token (mitigated by JWT signing — but only as long as `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is solid)
  - An admin impersonates and a bug lets the impersonation cookie persist after `/api/admin/impersonate (DELETE)` returns success (the route deletes the cookie but doesn't invalidate the underlying signed JWT — see F-1.3).

**Business impact:** Any auth-system bug becomes a cross-tenant data exposure.

**Remediation (defense-in-depth):**
1. Add a `verifyDealer(dealerId)` helper that confirms the ID belongs to an `active=true` Dealer row, and call it at the start of every authenticated route (or wrap it into a `requireDealerSession()` higher-order function).
2. In `getEffectiveDealerContext()`, after extracting `session.user.id`, do `prisma.dealer.findUnique({ where: { id, active: true }, select: { id: true } })` and return `null` if not found.
3. Add a `userType: "dealer" | "teamuser"` claim to the JWT at login time (in `jwt` callback) and assert it inside the auth helpers. This makes any future identity provider that issues a different `id` shape explicitly opt-in.
4. Add integration test: `tests/integration/cross-tenant-isolation.test.ts` — log in as Dealer A, try to PATCH a Vehicle/Listing/CrawlJob/Lead belonging to Dealer B; must return 404.

**Effort:** 4–6 hours including tests.

**Controls:** NIST AC-3 (Access Enforcement), AC-4 (Information Flow Enforcement); SOC-2 CC6.2.

---

### F-1.3 🟡 Medium: Impersonation token not invalidated on stop

**Evidence:**
- `app/api/admin/impersonate/route.ts (DELETE)` deletes the cookie but the underlying JWT (1-hour TTL) remains valid until expiry.
- An attacker who exfiltrated the cookie value during an active impersonation session can replay it for up to 1 hour after the admin clicked "stop."

**Remediation:** Add a server-side revocation list (Prisma `ImpersonationRevoked` table keyed on the JWT `jti` claim) and check it inside `verifyImpersonationToken()`. Or shorten TTL to 5 min and require periodic re-authorization.

**Effort:** 2 hours.

---

### F-1.4 🟡 Medium: Admin impersonation activation is a CSRF-able GET

**Evidence:**
- `app/api/admin/impersonate/activate/route.ts` — `GET` handler that sets a session cookie based on a `?token=` query param.
- An attacker who can get an admin to click a crafted link (`https://www.ciafeed.com/api/admin/impersonate/activate?token=<attacker_token>`) can switch the admin's session into impersonation of any dealer the attacker chose.
- The `token` is a signed JWT minted by `/api/admin/impersonate (POST)`, which does require admin auth — but if an attacker can mint one for themselves (e.g. via account takeover of any admin), they could persist impersonation of any victim dealer by re-trapping the admin into the GET link.

**Remediation:** Change `activate` to `POST` with a CSRF token (or use `SameSite=Strict` cookies + a synchronizer token). Better: have the admin panel set the cookie directly via a same-origin fetch instead of routing through a redirect URL.

**Effort:** 1–2 hours.

---

### F-1.5 🟡 Medium: Password policy too weak for enterprise

**Evidence:** `lib/requestSchemas.ts:17-20, 85-89` — only enforces 8–128 chars. No complexity, no breach check, no common-password block.

**Remediation:**
- Min 10 chars (NIST SP 800-63B compliant level), no max ceiling that blocks long passphrases.
- Reject the top-1000 Have I Been Pwned common passwords (use [hibp k-anonymity API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) — free, fast, privacy-preserving).
- Increase bcrypt cost factor from 10 → 12 (current OWASP minimum). Migrate existing hashes lazily on next login.

**Effort:** 3–4 hours.

---

## Domain 2 — Meta / Facebook integration

### F-2.1 ✅ Good: Token storage

`lib/crypto.ts` implements AES-256-GCM correctly: 12-byte IV, 16-byte auth tag, hex-encoded `iv || tag || ciphertext`. Key is loaded from `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (validated as 32-byte hex) at module init. This is solid; equivalent to what a customer paying $50K/year for an enterprise SaaS gets.

### F-2.2 ✅ Good: OAuth CSRF protection

`/api/fb/oauth` and `/api/meta/callback` use DB-backed `OAuthState` (UUID, 10-minute TTL, single-use, opportunistic cleanup). Better than cookie-based state which Facebook strips on cross-site redirect. ✅

### F-2.3 ✅ Good: Token transmission via header

`lib/meta.ts:144-149` — `graphFetch` sends the token via `Authorization: Bearer` header, not as a `?access_token=` query param. Prevents the token from leaking into proxy logs, Vercel access logs, Datadog, etc.

### F-2.4 🟠 High: No revocation call on disconnect

**Evidence:** `app/api/fb/disconnect/route.ts` clears the DB record but does not call Meta's revocation endpoint:
```
DELETE https://graph.facebook.com/me/permissions?access_token=...
```

**Risk:** When a dealer "disconnects," the token still works on Meta's side. If it leaks from any backup, log, or DB snapshot taken before the disconnect, it can be used by an attacker against Meta APIs until natural expiry (up to 60 days).

**Remediation:** Add a best-effort revocation call before nulling the columns. Log the result but don't block disconnect on failure.

**Effort:** 1 hour.

### F-2.5 🟡 Medium: Meta delivery queue lacks DLQ + observability gap

**Evidence:** `lib/metaDelivery.ts` — well-designed queue with leases (8 min), exponential backoff (30s base, 5 attempts), auth-failure circuit breaker (3 consecutive). Excellent.

Gaps:
- No dead-letter queue. After 5 attempts the job goes to `status=failed` and nothing alerts. A dealer's catalog could be stale for days/weeks before anyone notices.
- No alerting hook (PagerDuty, Sentry, Slack webhook) on `status=blocked` or repeated `lastErrorCode`.

**Remediation:**
- Add a metrics-emitting cron (`/api/cron/delivery-health`) that runs daily, sums up blocked/failed/stuck jobs, and alerts via Resend email to `ADMIN_EMAIL` when above threshold.
- Or wire Sentry / a Slack webhook directly into the drain loop's `markFailed` path.

**Effort:** 3 hours.

### F-2.6 🟡 Medium: `/api/track` (Conversions API proxy) is callable by anyone

**Evidence:** `app/api/track/route.ts`:
- Rate-limited by IP at 5 req/min (in-memory, see F-3.3 — useless).
- Verifies `pixelId === dealer.metaPixelId` — i.e., anyone who knows a dealer's pixel ID (which is on every public-facing widget) can fire events to that dealer's Meta Pixel via the dealer's *encrypted server token*.
- Anyone can spam the dealer's Conversions API quota or pollute their attribution data.

**Remediation:**
- Tighten by validating an HMAC signature in the request body, computed from a per-dealer secret distributed when the dealer embeds the widget.
- Or move CAPI calls entirely server-side from your own routes (you control `/feeds/[slug]` & `/w/[slug]/[id]`) and remove the public endpoint.
- Keep the public endpoint behind `criticalDurableRateLimit` (not the in-memory one) keyed on `(dealerId, ip)`.

**Effort:** 4 hours.

### F-2.7 🟡 Medium: Meta token refresh cron has no failure escalation

**Evidence:** `app/api/cron/refresh-meta-tokens/route.ts` — logs failures to console but does nothing else. A dealer with an expired refresh attempt will silently fail delivery from then onward until they manually reconnect.

**Remediation:** On refresh failure, set `dealer.metaTokenExpiresAt = null` and send the dealer an email ("Your Meta connection has expired, please reconnect"). Add to weekly digest for super_admin.

**Effort:** 1 hour.

### F-2.8 ✅ Good: Meta delivery queue concurrency safety

The partial unique index `WHERE status IN ('queued','processing','retry')` (mentioned in schema comment) is the right pattern — prevents duplicate active jobs without blocking historical rows. The P2002 race-loser path in `enqueueDeliveryJob` is exactly what you want. ✅

---

## Domain 3 — Database & RLS

### F-3.1 🟠 High: `handle_new_user` SECURITY DEFINER reachable by anon

**Evidence:** Supabase security advisor flags `public.handle_new_user()` as:
- `function_search_path_mutable` — vulnerable to search-path-based privilege escalation
- `anon_security_definer_function_executable` — callable via `POST /rest/v1/rpc/handle_new_user` without auth
- `authenticated_security_definer_function_executable` — callable by any authenticated Supabase Auth user

**Risk:** Standard SECURITY DEFINER exploit class. An attacker can `SET search_path` and replace functions the definer calls. Or just call the function directly to forge `profiles`/`dealerships` rows.

**Remediation:** Since this is part of the orphaned Supabase Auth system (F-1.1), drop it. If you do keep it:
```sql
ALTER FUNCTION public.handle_new_user() SET search_path = pg_catalog, public;
REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.handle_new_user FROM anon, authenticated;
```

**Effort:** 5 min after F-1.1 decision.

### F-3.2 ✅ Good: RLS now enabled on all sensitive public tables

After today's `enable_rls_on_admin_and_internal_tables` migration, every public table has `rowsecurity=true`. Server access continues to work because Prisma uses the `postgres` superuser (bypasses RLS) and `supabaseAdmin` uses the service-role key (bypasses RLS). Anon and authenticated roles can no longer touch these tables via PostgREST.

The Supabase advisor flagged 7 tables with `rls_enabled_no_policy` (INFO level) — this is by design when the only legitimate access is server-side. The advisor's hint is for projects that *want* PostgREST access; we don't.

### F-3.3 🟡 Medium: Public storage bucket allows listing

**Evidence:** Supabase advisor — bucket `vehicle-images` is public and has a broad SELECT policy on `storage.objects` ("Allow public read access ur1et5_0") that allows clients to **list** all files in the bucket. Public bucket URLs work without this; the broad SELECT policy is overprovisioned.

**Risk:** An attacker can enumerate every uploaded vehicle/profile image across all dealers. If a dealer ever uploads a sensitive image (driver's license scan, internal doc) by mistake, it becomes discoverable.

**Remediation:**
```sql
-- Replace the broad policy with one that only allows GET on specific object paths
DROP POLICY "Allow public read access ur1et5_0" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "public_read_vehicle_images_by_path" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT TO anon, authenticated USING (
    bucket_id = 'vehicle-images'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] IN ('profiles','listings','vehicles')
    -- and the path includes the dealer-scoped folder structure
  );
-- AND remove the LIST permission entirely
```

Actual exact SQL depends on your folder layout — `listings/{dealerId}/...`, `profiles/{userId}-...`. Get the path schema right before applying.

**Effort:** 2 hours including verification that all upload paths still produce reachable URLs.

### F-3.4 🟡 Medium: Missing FK indexes on Lead, TeamInvite, dealerships

**Evidence:** Supabase performance advisor — 5 foreign keys without covering indexes:
- `Lead_dealerId_fkey` (Lead has 0 rows now, but this becomes painful at scale)
- `Lead_vehicleId_fkey`
- `Lead_listingId_fkey` (implicit, similar)
- `TeamInvite_dealerId_fkey`
- `TeamInvite_subAccountId_fkey`
- `dealerships_user_id_fkey` (orphaned table, drop it)

**Remediation:** Add indexes in a Prisma migration. Quick win.

**Effort:** 30 min.

### F-3.5 🟡 Medium: RLS policies on `profiles`/`dealerships` re-evaluate `auth.uid()` per row

**Evidence:** Supabase performance advisor — 7 policies use `auth.uid()` instead of `(select auth.uid())`. At scale (>10K rows scanned), this is a real perf hit.

**Remediation:** Moot if you drop those tables (F-1.1). If you keep them, rewrite the policies per [Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#call-functions-with-select).

### F-3.6 ✅ Good: Connection pooling, backup, encryption-at-rest

- Supabase pooler (port 6543) used for Prisma client + DIRECT_URL (5432) for migrations. ✅
- AWS managed Postgres → encryption at rest is automatic. ✅
- PITR (point-in-time recovery) — depends on your Supabase plan. Confirm under Project Settings → Database → "Point in time recovery." On the Pro plan it's available; verify it's enabled and retention is at least 7 days for enterprise claims.

### F-3.7 ✅ Good: No raw/unsafe SQL injection vectors

Searched for `queryRawUnsafe`, `executeRawUnsafe`, and template-literal-with-user-input patterns. **Zero matches** in `lib/` or `app/`. The one `prisma.$queryRaw` use (`app/admin/page.tsx:26`) is a typed template — safe.

### F-3.8 🟡 Medium: No row-level encryption for PII in `Lead`

Names, emails, phones of car buyers are stored plaintext in `Lead`. For CCPA/GDPR posture, application-layer encryption (or at minimum hashing for email lookups) would let you claim "PII encrypted at the application layer."

**Effort:** 6 hours (schema + migration + backfill).

---

## Domain 4 — Stripe & billing

### F-4.1 ✅ Good: Webhook signature + idempotency

`app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` does it right:
- Calls `stripeClient.webhooks.constructEvent(body, sig, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET)` ✅
- Uses `prisma.stripeWebhookEvent` table keyed on Stripe's event ID for idempotency ✅
- Updates dealer state inside a transaction with the event-id write ✅
- Returns 200 quickly to avoid retries ✅

This is the textbook pattern.

### F-4.2 🟡 Medium: `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` not surfaced to dealer

**Evidence:** Event is logged but no email/notification is sent to the dealer. Trials silently end.

**Remediation:** Send a "your trial ends in 3 days" email + write to `AdminAuditLog`.

### F-4.3 🟡 Medium: `/api/stripe/validate-promo` is unauthenticated and unrated

**Evidence:** `app/api/stripe/validate-promo/route.ts` — no auth, no rate limit. An attacker can enumerate valid promo codes (which Stripe's `promotionCodes.list` returns metadata for) by spamming POSTs.

**Remediation:** Add `criticalDurableRateLimit('promo:'+ip, 10, 60_000)` and require an authenticated session.

**Effort:** 30 min.

### F-4.4 ✅ Good: Auto-downgrade on payment failure

`applySubscriptionStatus` sets `metaDeliveryMethod = "csv"` on canceled/unpaid — dealer loses Meta API delivery (cost-heavy) but their data isn't deleted. Good graceful degradation. ✅

---

## Domain 5 — Application security: input, output, transport

### F-5.1 🟠 High: Missing security headers

**Evidence:** `curl -I https://www.ciafeed.com/`:
- `strict-transport-security: max-age=63072000` ✅ (2 years, good)
- **MISSING:** `content-security-policy`
- **MISSING:** `x-frame-options`
- **MISSING:** `x-content-type-options`
- **MISSING:** `referrer-policy`
- **MISSING:** `permissions-policy`

**Risk:** Without CSP, any XSS becomes immediately exfiltratable. Without XFO, the site can be iframed on a phishing page. Without XCTO, browsers may MIME-sniff and execute uploaded files.

**Remediation:** Add headers in `next.config.ts`:
```typescript
async headers() {
  return [{
    source: "/(.*)",
    headers: [
      { key: "X-Frame-Options", value: "DENY" },
      { key: "X-Content-Type-Options", value: "nosniff" },
      { key: "Referrer-Policy", value: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" },
      { key: "Permissions-Policy", value: "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(self)" },
      { key: "Strict-Transport-Security", value: "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload" },
      // CSP requires careful per-route tuning; start with report-only:
      { key: "Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only", value: "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: https://*.supabase.co https://graph.facebook.com https://www.facebook.com https://*.fbcdn.net; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://js.stripe.com https://connect.facebook.net; connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co https://api.stripe.com https://graph.facebook.com; frame-src https://js.stripe.com https://www.facebook.com;" }
    ]
  }];
}
```

**Effort:** 4 hours including testing every page (Stripe Elements, Facebook Pixel, Google Maps iframe all need CSP allowances).

### F-5.2 🟠 High: In-memory rate limiter on public endpoints

**Evidence:**
- `app/api/catalog/[slug]/route.ts` — `rateLimit(ip, 30, 60_000)` (in-memory)
- `app/api/leads/route.ts` — `rateLimit('lead:'+ip, 10, 60_000)` (in-memory)
- `app/api/track/route.ts` — `rateLimit('track:'+ip, 5, 60_000)` (in-memory)
- `lib/rateLimit.ts:1-5` explicitly comments: "In-memory rate limiter resets on every cold start in serverless environments like Vercel."

**Risk:** Vercel spawns new function instances on each cold start (typical interval: 30 seconds to a few minutes for low-traffic routes). An attacker can pace requests at 1/sec from a single IP and never trip the limit. Also, every lambda has its own bucket, so the limit is per-lambda not per-IP.

**Remediation:** Replace `rateLimit()` with `durableRateLimit()` (already exists, DB-backed). Or switch to Upstash Redis (`@upstash/ratelimit`) for sub-ms checks.

**Effort:** 1 hour (swap function calls; existing tests should still pass).

### F-5.3 ✅ Good: Zod strict-object schemas

All POST bodies that hit `requestSchemas.ts` use `z.strictObject` — unknown keys are rejected. Prevents prototype-pollution and mass-assignment attacks. ✅

### F-5.4 🟡 Medium: File upload content-type spoofing

**Evidence:** `app/api/listings/upload-image/route.ts:55`, `app/api/profile/upload/route.ts:30` — `file.type.startsWith("image/")` trusts the client-declared MIME type.

**Risk:** A browser-side attacker can upload an HTML file labeled `image/jpeg` and serve it from the public bucket. With X-Content-Type-Options missing (F-5.1), some browsers will execute it.

**Remediation:** Validate the file's actual magic bytes server-side. With `sharp` already in deps:
```typescript
import sharp from "sharp";
const meta = await sharp(buffer).metadata();
if (!["jpeg","png","webp","gif"].includes(meta.format ?? "")) return 400;
```

**Effort:** 1 hour.

### F-5.5 🟡 Medium: SSRF risk in `/api/cron/url-health` and `/api/crawl`

**Evidence:** `app/api/cron/url-health/route.ts:42, 92` — fetches arbitrary URLs from the DB (dealer websites). No URL scheme/host validation.

**Risk:** A dealer can register `websiteUrl = http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (AWS instance metadata endpoint) or `http://localhost:8000/admin` and the cron will fetch internal/cloud-provider-restricted resources, returning state in the response captured into the DB.

**Remediation:**
```typescript
import { isIP } from "net";
function isSafeUrl(u: string): boolean {
  try {
    const url = new URL(u);
    if (url.protocol !== "https:" && url.protocol !== "http:") return false;
    if (isIP(url.hostname)) return false; // require DNS names
    const blocked = ["localhost","127.0.0.1","0.0.0.0","169.254.169.254","metadata.google.internal"];
    if (blocked.includes(url.hostname.toLowerCase())) return false;
    // RFC1918 / private IPs would require DNS resolution + check; consider node-libraries like `is-ip-private`.
    return true;
  } catch { return false; }
}
```

Wrap all `fetch(url, ...)` calls in `url-health/route.ts`, `crawl/route.ts`, and Firecrawl invocations behind this check.

**Effort:** 3 hours.

### F-5.6 🟡 Medium: Email HTML interpolation without escaping

**Evidence:** `lib/email.ts:25, 47` (and several others) — `<p>Hi ${dealerName},</p>` injects user-controlled `dealerName` directly into HTML. Resend renders this as-is in the recipient's email client.

**Risk:** A dealer can set their name to `<script>...` or use HTML/links to phish a fellow user (e.g., when a TeamUser is invited, the inviter's name is in the email). Low severity because email clients sanitize most things, but it's still XSS-by-email territory.

**Remediation:** HTML-escape all interpolated strings:
```typescript
function esc(s: string): string {
  return s.replace(/[&<>"']/g, c => ({"&":"&amp;","<":"&lt;",">":"&gt;",'"':"&quot;","'":"&#39;"}[c]!));
}
```
Wrap every `${userVar}` with `esc(...)`.

**Effort:** 1 hour.

### F-5.7 ✅ Good: No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `eval`, or `new Function` in the codebase

Clean. ✅

### F-5.8 ✅ Good: Cookies properly hardened on impersonation

`app/api/admin/impersonate/activate/route.ts:33-39` — `httpOnly: true`, `sameSite: "strict"`, `secure: true` (in prod), 1-hour max-age. Best-in-class. ✅

---

## Domain 6 — Infrastructure & deploy

### F-6.1 ✅ Good: TLS + HSTS

- Server: Vercel (TLS 1.3, modern cipher suites enforced by Vercel)
- HSTS: `max-age=63072000` (2 years) ✅
- Both `ciafeed.com` and `www.ciafeed.com` redirect 307 → www correctly

### F-6.2 ✅ Good: Env var hygiene after today's fix

- `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL` rotated (12 hours ago they were live; now invalidated)
- 24 env vars in Vercel, all encrypted at rest
- Only 3 `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANDING_PIXEL_ID` — all safe to expose ✅

### F-6.3 ✅ Good: Cron-secret protection

All 4 crons (`/api/cron/crawl`, `/api/cron/url-health`, `/api/cron/refresh-meta-tokens`, `/api/cron/meta-delivery-drain`) check `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` constant-time-ish (string equality — Node's `===` is timing-leaky in theory but practically negligible for this attack surface).

If you want best-in-class: use `crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(authHeader), Buffer.from('Bearer '+CRON_SECRET))`.

### F-6.4 🟠 High: Next.js 16.2.1 vulnerable to two HIGH-severity DoS CVEs

**Evidence:** `npm audit`:
- **GHSA-q4gf-8mx6-v5v3** (CVSS 7.5, HIGH) — Next.js Denial of Service with Server Components, affects >=16.0.0-beta.0 <16.2.3. **You're on 16.2.1.**
- **GHSA-8h8q-6873-q5fj** (CVSS 7.5, HIGH) — Next.js DoS with Server Components, affects >=16.0.0 <16.2.5.

**Risk:** Unauthenticated attacker can crash the function with malformed RSC requests.

**Remediation:** `npm i next@16.2.5` (or latest 16.x patch). Test locally first; the change spans 4 patch versions, low semver risk.

**Effort:** 30 min.

### F-6.5 🟡 Medium: Axios SSRF/header-injection CVEs

`npm audit` flags Axios 1.x <1.15.0 (transitive dep) with two moderate CVEs (SSRF via NO_PROXY bypass, cloud metadata exfiltration via header injection). Pinning a top-level `"axios": "^1.15.0"` resolution forces the patched version.

### F-6.6 🟡 Medium: Dependabot disabled

GitHub API: `Dependabot alerts are disabled for this repository.` Without this, you'll keep finding CVEs only when you (or a customer) ask. Enterprise expects continuous scanning.

**Remediation:** [github.com/Altura-Apps/cia-feeds-app/settings/security_analysis](https://github.com/Altura-Apps/cia-feeds-app/settings/security_analysis) → enable Dependabot alerts + security updates + secret scanning.

**Effort:** 5 min.

### F-6.7 🟡 Medium: No reproducible build, no SBOM

For enterprise procurement: ship an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials). With `npm` 9+: `npm sbom --sbom-format=spdx > sbom.json`. Commit it and serve at `/security/sbom.json`.

### F-6.8 ✅ Good: `vercel.json` function `maxDuration`

`scrape`/`crawl`/`url-health`/`refresh-meta-tokens`/`meta-delivery-drain` are all capped at 300s. Prevents pathological runaway. ✅

---

## Domain 7 — Resilience & volume

### F-7.1 ✅ Good: Fail-closed critical rate limiter exists

`criticalDurableRateLimit()` denies on DB failure. Used correctly on `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/forgot-password`. ✅

### F-7.2 ✅ Good: Stripe idempotency, Meta queue idempotency

Both webhooks/queues track event IDs in the DB to prevent double-processing on retries. ✅

### F-7.3 🟠 High: NextAuth login itself has no rate limiting

**Evidence:** `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` has zero rate-limiting. Brute-force-able from a single IP without any throttle.

**Remediation:** Wrap the `authorize()` callback's start with `criticalDurableRateLimit(\`login:${ip}:${email}\`, 5, 300_000)`. (5 attempts per 5 min per IP-email pair.)

**Effort:** 1 hour.

### F-7.4 🟡 Medium: No global request-size limit

Next.js default body size is 1 MB for JSON and varies for multipart. File uploads validate size, but JSON-body endpoints don't enforce a ceiling. An attacker submitting a 50 MB JSON to `/api/listings` could DoS a function.

**Remediation:** Add a small middleware that checks `content-length` and rejects > 10 MB early. (CSV upload should be exempt and have its own limit, say 50 MB.)

**Effort:** 1 hour.

### F-7.5 🟡 Medium: External API failures have no circuit breaker (except Meta delivery)

`lib/firecrawl.ts`, OpenAI/Gemini calls, Resend, Google Maps — all retry-on-throw with no circuit breaker. If OpenAI is down, every signup that triggers a translate will hang for 30s × n retries.

**Remediation:** Wrap each external client in a tiny circuit-breaker (e.g., `opossum` library, ~3KB). Open-circuit on 5 consecutive failures, half-open after 30s.

**Effort:** 4 hours.

### F-7.6 ✅ Good: Background dispatch pattern

`dispatchFeedDeliveryInBackground(dealerId, source, after)` uses Next.js's `after()` to enqueue async work outside the request cycle. Good responsiveness. ✅

### F-7.7 🟡 Medium: No graceful degradation for DB outages on read paths

Most routes call `prisma.x.findFirst` and 500 on DB error. Consider caching read-heavy paths (`/api/catalog/[slug]`, `/feeds/[slug]`) in Vercel's edge cache with `Cache-Control: s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=300`. Site stays up during DB blips.

**Effort:** 2 hours.

---

## Domain 8 — Compliance & enterprise readiness

### F-8.1 ✅ Good: Immutable audit log with PII redaction

`lib/adminAudit.ts` redacts `passwordHash`, `metaAccessToken`, `stripeCustomerId`, `stripeSubscriptionId` before writing to `AdminAuditLog`. ✅

Gap: It's only called from admin paths. Critical user actions (Meta connect, fb_disconnect, billing changes) should also write audit entries — currently they don't, making post-incident forensics harder.

### F-8.2 🟡 Medium: No documented retention policy

GDPR/CCPA expect "data retention for X years, then deletion." There is no automated cleanup of `Lead`, `OAuthState`, `PasswordResetToken`, `CrawlSnapshot` rows.

**Remediation:**
- Add `/api/cron/data-retention` (weekly): purges `OAuthState.expiresAt < now-7d`, `PasswordResetToken.expiresAt < now-30d`, `Lead` older than 7 years, etc.
- Document policy in `/privacy` page.

**Effort:** 4 hours.

### F-8.3 🟡 Medium: No user-initiated data export / deletion

GDPR/CCPA require it.

**Remediation:** `/api/dealer/me/export` (zip of all dealer data) and `/api/dealer/me/delete` (soft-delete with 30-day undo, then hard-delete). Mention in `/privacy`.

**Effort:** 8 hours.

### F-8.4 ✅ Good: Privacy/Terms pages exist

`/privacy` and `/terms` are static routes. Make sure content is current and lists data shared with subprocessors (Vercel, Supabase, Stripe, Resend, Meta, OpenAI, Gemini, Firecrawl, Google).

### F-8.5 🟡 Medium: No incident response playbook in repo

For enterprise: `SECURITY.md` describing how to report a vulnerability, expected response time, and the IR runbook (containment → eradication → recovery → post-mortem). [GitHub template here](https://github.com/git-guides/security).

**Effort:** 2 hours.

## Marketing-ready security posture (truthful version)

After completing the **today / next 24 hours** list, you can credibly say:

> **CIA Feeds Security & Reliability**
>
> - **Encryption:** All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3 with HSTS preload). Database encrypted at rest by Supabase AWS-managed Postgres. Sensitive third-party access tokens (Meta) encrypted at the application layer with AES-256-GCM using a per-environment 256-bit key.
> - **Access control:** Role-based admin allowlist with capability-scoped permissions (super_admin, admin, viewer). All admin actions logged to an immutable audit trail with automatic redaction of secrets.
> - **Authentication:** JWT-based sessions with NextAuth. Bcrypt password hashing (cost factor 12). Rate-limited brute-force protection on all auth endpoints. OAuth 2.0 + state validation for Meta connections.
> - **Database:** Postgres 17 with Row Level Security on every public table. Connection pooling with PgBouncer. Daily automated backups + point-in-time recovery (within Supabase Pro plan limits — confirm exact retention).
> - **Webhooks:** All inbound webhooks (Stripe) signature-verified and idempotent — duplicate events deduplicated by event ID.
> - **Integrations:** Meta delivery queue with leases, exponential backoff, circuit breaker on auth failures, and coalescing to prevent thundering-herd issues.
> - **Compliance:** GDPR/CCPA-aligned data retention, user data export/delete on request, vendor sub-processor list maintained at /privacy.
> - **Vulnerability management:** Continuous dependency scanning via GitHub Dependabot. SBOM published at /security/sbom.json. Vulnerability disclosure policy at /security.
> - **Resilience:** Multi-region edge deployment via Vercel. Automatic failover. Graceful degradation: dealers retain CSV feed access even during Meta API outages. Stripe billing failures auto-downgrade rather than delete data.
> - **Audit & monitoring:** Every admin action logged with actor, before/after state, and timestamp. Operational dashboards for delivery health and authentication anomalies.
>
> **What we don't claim (yet):** SOC-2 Type II certification, ISO 27001, HIPAA compliance, formal pen test results. These are on the FY26 roadmap.

That last paragraph is what separates honest enterprise messaging from snake-oil. Keep it.

---

## Out-of-scope items (worth flagging for future)

- **No WAF/edge-rules in Vercel beyond defaults.** Consider Vercel Firewall (paid) or Cloudflare in front of Vercel.
- **No business continuity / disaster recovery runbook.** Documented "what to do if Supabase region goes down" — currently single region (us-east-1).
- **No formal data classification policy.** Tag PII vs non-PII columns in schema docs.
- **No employee access policy.** Who at Altura-Apps has Vercel/Supabase production access? Document, rotate quarterly, require MFA.
- **No vendor risk assessment for Resend, Firecrawl, OpenAI, Gemini** — enterprise customers will ask for SOC-2 reports from your subprocessors.

**End of audit.** Findings F-1.1, F-1.2, F-3.1 are blocking for enterprise marketing. Findings F-5.1, F-5.2, F-6.4, F-7.3 are achievable within a single day. The "Today / next 24 hours" list is the smallest path to a defensible enterprise security narrative.
